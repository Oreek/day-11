# Meow!
Hello! And first of all thank you for trying out my site. It means a lot!

## whoami
I am __[Oreek](https://github.com/Oreek)__, an average student as well as an average programmer!

At the time of writing this post, I am in __11th Grade__ and my studies have been just fine these days.

Btw things I like include food, music, coding (ofcourse) and my friends!


## What am I Good at?

I am pretty much good at absolutely nothing but if I have to point out some things, it would be composing poems, making mobile apps (android specially), procastinating and doomscrolling.

## Why is This Blog So Short???

Actually it's late in the night for me rn and I'm feeling really sleepy. So I do not really have much ideas to write about as of now.

## Fun Fact

~~I like kidnapping kittens!~~
